# Day 2 Solution

This repository contains the solution for Day 2 of the coding challenge.

## Solution Overview

### Part 1

Given a set of games with counts of red, green, and blue cubes, we are tasked with determining which games would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes. Additionally, we need to calculate the sum of the IDs of those games.

### Part 2

For each game, we are required to find the minimum set of cubes that must have been present. Then, we need to calculate the sum of the power of these sets.
